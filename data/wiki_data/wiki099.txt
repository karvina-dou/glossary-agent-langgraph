Apostal, telegraph, and telephone service(orPTT) is agovernment agencyresponsible forpostal mail,telegraph, andtelephoneservices.  Suchmonopoliesexisted in many countries, though not inNorth America,JapanorSpain. Many PTTs have been partially or completelyprivatisedin recent years, though a few, such asPosta ve Telgraf TeşkilatıofTurkey,Myanma Posts and TelecommunicationsofMyanmarandTusassofGreenland, continue to remain wholly government-owned. In many of said privatisations, the privatised corporation was completely renamed, such asKPNin theNetherlands,Orange S.A.inFrance(+Orange PolskainPoland),BT Groupin theUnited Kingdom,Eirin theRepublic of Ireland,SwisscominSwitzerland,TelstrainAustralia,SparkinNew Zealand,Proximus GroupinBelgium,A1 Telekom Austria GroupinAustria,TDC GroupinDenmark,Telia CompanyinSwedenandFinland,TelenorinNorway,Chunghwa TelecominTaiwanandSingtelinSingapore; whereas in others, the name of the privatised corporation has been only slightly modified, such asTelkom IndonesiainIndonesia,Telekom MalaysiainMalaysia,Deutsche TelekominGermany(+Hrvatski TelekominCroatiaandTelekom Romania MobileinRomania),Kosovo TelecominKosovo,KTinSouth Korea,Post LuxembourginLuxembourgandSíminninIceland.
In countries that had a PTT unit of government, typically the vast majority of forms of distribution of information fell under the auspices of the PTT, whether that be the delivery of printed publications and individual letters in the postal mail, the transmission of telephonic audio, or the transmission of telegraphic on-off signals, and in some countries, thebroadcast of one-way (audio) radioand(audio-video) television signals. In many countries with a current or former PTT, the PTT was also responsible for the manufacture and standardisation of telephone equipment. Often the presence of a single PTT in a country implied a single monolithic approach to the distribution of information in that country, which as an advantage permitted efficient deployment of a single national standard for each topic instead of ongoing debate about competing ideas, but which as a disadvantage typically stifled alternative ideas from emerging once a legacy implementation had been widely deployed.
In North America, instead of a PTT there was the private monopolyBell System(for theUS)/Bell Canada(dominantILECinOntario,Quebecand (historically) parts of what is nowNunavut; competes with other fixed-line carriers in the rest ofCanada) responsible fortelecommunicationsand a separate federally runUS Postal Service/Canada Postformaildelivery. Japan also had a rather similar structure as North America with the formerly-state-ownedNippon Telegraph and Telephone(NTT; privatised in 1985) having a monopoly on fixed-line telecoms, with the separate government-run but publicly-tradedJapan Postresponsible for mail delivery; as did Spain withCompañía Telefónica Nacional de España(CTNE; privatised in 1997) having a monopoly on fixed-line telecoms, with the separate state-ownedCorreos de Españaresponsible for mail delivery.
Portugal, until 1968, had a mixture, with a private telecom operator inLisbonandPorto(named APT –Anglo-Portuguese Telephone Company) another private company in charge of connections with and between colonies and with the rest of the world (CPRM –Companhia Portuguesa de Rádio Marconi) andCorreios, Telefones e Telégrafos, a public company, as the PTT agency and owner of the telephone system in the rest of the country (including theformer colonies); that year, APT was nationalised and becameTelefones de Lisboa e Porto(TLP). CTT still controls postal services in Portugal, while Telecom Portugal was spun out in 1992 and later merged intoPortugal Telecomin 1994 (with CPRM becoming a subsidiary and later being absorbed in 2002); it is privatised and subject to competition.
