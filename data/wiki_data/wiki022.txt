ACSU/DSU(channel service unit/data service unit) is a digital-interface device used to connectdata terminal equipment(DTE), such as arouter, to adigital circuit, such as aDigital Signal 1(DS1) T1 line. The CSU/DSU implements two different functions. Thechannel service unit(CSU) is responsible for the connection to thetelecommunicationnetwork, while thedata service unit(DSU)  is responsible for managing the interface with the DTE. A CSU/DSU can have an external connection point or it can be integrated into a modular card installed in a router.
A CSU/DSU is the equivalent of the modem for an entireLAN. The DCE, commonly a modem or CSU/DSU, is the device used to convert the user data from the DTE into a form acceptable to the WAN service provider transmission link.
TheWAN Interface Card(WIC) may contain an integrated CSU/DSU that can be inserted into a router slot. An example of a WIC is the 1-port 56/64-kbit/s DSU/CSU WIC (WIC-1DSU-56K4) by Cisco Systems. DTE is generally a router, but can also be a terminal, computer, printer, or fax machine if they connect directly to the service provider network.
