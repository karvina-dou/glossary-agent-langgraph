TheMultimedia over Coax Alliance(MoCA) is an international standards consortium that publishes specifications fornetworkingovercoaxial cable. The technology was originally developed to distributeIP televisionin homes using existing cabling, but is now used as a general-purposeEthernetlink where it is inconvenient or undesirable to replace existing coaxial cable withoptical fiberortwisted paircabling.
MoCA 1.0 was approved in 2006, MoCA 1.1 in April 2010, MoCA 2.0 in June 2010, and MoCA 2.5 in April 2016.The most recently released version of the standard, MoCA 3.0, supports speeds of up to10Â Gbit/s. This technology is not yet available to customers.
The Alliance currently has 45 members including pay TV operators, OEMs, CE manufacturers and IC vendors.
MoCA's board of directors consists ofArris,Comcast,Cox Communications,DirecTV,Echostar,Intel,InCoax,MaxLinearandVerizon.
Within the scope of theInternet protocol suite, MoCA is a protocol that provides thelink layer. In the 7-layerOSI model, it provides definitions within thedata link layer(layer 2) and thephysical layer(layer 1).DLNAapproved of MoCA as a layer 2 protocol.A MoCA network can contain up to 16 nodes for MoCA 1.1 and higher, with a maximum of 8 for MoCA 1.0.The network provides a shared-medium, half-duplex link between all nodes using time-division multiplexing; within each timeslot, any pair of nodes communicates directly with each other using the highest mutually-supported version of the standard.
