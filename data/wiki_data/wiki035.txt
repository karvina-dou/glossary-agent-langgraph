TheDesktop Management Interface(DMI) generates a standardframeworkfor managing and trackingcomponentsin a desktop, notebook or servercomputer, byabstractingthese components from the software that manages them. The development of DMI, 2.0 version June 24, 1998,marked the first move by theDistributed Management Task Force(DMTF) into desktop-management standards.Before the introduction of DMI, no standardized source of information could provide details about components in apersonal computer.
Due to the rapid development of DMTF technologies, such asCommon Information Model(CIM), the DMTF defined an "End of Life" process for DMI, which ended on March 31, 2005.
From 1999,MicrosoftrequiredOEMsand BIOS vendors to support the DMI interface/data-set in order to have Microsoft certification.
DMI exposes system data (including theSystem Management BIOS(SMBIOS) data) to management software, but the two specifications function independently.
DMI is commonly confused with SMBIOS, which was actually called DMIBIOS in its first revisions.
When software queries a memory-resident agent that resides in the background, it responds by sending data in MIFs (Management Information Format) or activating MIF routines. Static data in a MIF would contain items such as model ID, serial number, memory- and port-addresses. A MIF routine could read memory and report its contents.
DMI can co-exist withSNMPand other management protocols. For example, when an SNMP query arrives, DMI can fill out the SNMPMIBwith data from its MIF. A single workstation or server can serve as a proxy agent that would contain the SNMP module and service an entireLANsegment of DMI-capable machines.
