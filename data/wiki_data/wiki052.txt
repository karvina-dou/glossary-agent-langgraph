Anintermediate distribution frame(IDF) is adistribution framein acentral officeorcustomer premises, which cross connects theusercablemedia to individual userline circuitsand may serve as a distribution point for multipair cables from themain distribution frame(MDF) orcombined distribution frame(CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.
IDFs are used for telephone exchange central office, customer-premises equipment,wide area network(WAN), andlocal area network(LAN) environments, among others.
In central office environments the IDF may contain circuit termination equipment from various auxiliary components. In WAN and LAN environments IDFs can hold devices of different types includingbackupsystems (hard drivesor other media as self-contained, or asRAIDs,CD-ROMs, etc.),networking(switches,hubs,routers), and connections (fiber optics,coaxial,category cables) and so on.
