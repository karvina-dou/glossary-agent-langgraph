Adata circuit-terminating equipment(DCE) is a device that sits between thedata terminal equipment(DTE) and adata transmission circuit. It is also calleddata communication(s) equipmentanddata carrier equipment.Usually, the DTE device is theterminal(orcomputer), and the DCE is amodem.
In adata station, the DCE performs functions such assignalconversion,coding, and line clocking and may be a part of the DTE or intermediate equipment.Interfacing equipment may be required to couple the DTE into a transmission circuit orchanneland from a transmission circuit or channel into the DTE.
Although the terms are most commonly used withRS-232, several data communication standards define different types of interfaces between a DCE and a DTE. The DCE is a device that communicates with a DTE device in these standards. Standards that use this nomenclature include:
A general rule is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the provided clock (external clocking).D-subconnectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on pin connector number 2 and receive on pin connector number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: pin connector number 2 receives and pin connector number 3 transmits the signals.
When two devices, that are both DTE or both DCE, must be connected together without a modem or a similar media translator between them, acrossover cablemust be used, e.g. anull modemfor RS-232 or anEthernetcrossover cable/body
