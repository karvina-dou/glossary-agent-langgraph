Anon-broadcast multiple access network(NBMA) is acomputer networkto which multiple hosts are attached, but data is transmitted only directly from one computer to another single host over avirtual circuitor across aswitched fabric.
Some NBMA network devices supportmulticastandbroadcast trafficreplication (pseudo-broadcasts).This is done by send multiple copies of a broadcast packet, one through virtual circuit, so that the broadcast gets to all intended recipients.
TheITU-TG.hnstandard provides a specification for creating a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s)local area networkusing existing homepower lines, phone lines andcoaxial cables.
Because ofmultipath propagation, power lines use frequency-selective channels. Channel frequency response is different for each pair of transmitter and receiver, so modulation parameters are unique for each transmitter and receiver pair. Since each pair of devices uses a different modulation scheme for communication, other devices may not be able to demodulate the information sent between them.
In NBMA networks a special technique calledsplit horizon route advertisementmustbe disabled bydistance-vector routing protocolsin order to route traffic in a hub and spoke topology. The reason being is that split horizon dictates that a router cannot send a routing table update out of the same interface from which it received it. Thus eliminating the proper propagation from one location to another. This family of protocols relies onlink layerbroadcasting for route advertisement propagation, so when this feature is absent, it has to be emulated with a series ofunicasttransmissions, which may result in a receiver node sending a route advertisement back to the node it has just received it from.
