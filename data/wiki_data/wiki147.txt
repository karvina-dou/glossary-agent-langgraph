Awireless LAN controller(WLC) is a network device used to monitor and manage wireless access points in an organization. WLCs are connected to routers and allow devices from across the organization to connect to the router via access points. WLCs are generally used in combination with theLightweight Access Point Protocol(LWAPP) to manage light-weight access points in bulk by the network administrator ornetwork operations center.Thewireless LANcontroller is part of the Data Plane within the Cisco Wireless Model.
The WLAN controller automatically handles the configuration of wirelessaccess-points. It centralizes wireless network infrastructure and handles bandwidth allocation to the access points (APs). Before the use of WLCs were widespread, APs had to handle connections individually, leading to unstable data links and poor connections. The use of WLCs solves this problem.
