Read-only memory(ROM) is a type ofnon-volatile memoryused incomputersand otherelectronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be electronically modified after the manufacture of thememory device. Read-only memory is useful for storingsoftwarethat is rarely changed during the life of the system, also known asfirmware. Software applications, such asvideo games, for programmable devices can be distributed asplug-in cartridges containing ROM.
Strictly speaking,read-only memoryrefers to hard-wired memory, such asdiode matrixor amask ROMintegrated circuit(IC), that cannot be electronically changed after manufacture. Although discrete circuits can be altered in principle, through the addition ofbodge wiresand the removal or replacement of components, ICs cannot. Correction of errors, or updates to the software, require new devices to be manufactured and to replace the installed device.
Floating-gateROMsemiconductor memoryin the form oferasable programmable read-only memory(EPROM),electrically erasable programmable read-only memory(EEPROM) andflash memorycan be erased and re-programmed. But usually, this can only be done at relatively slow speeds, may require special equipment to achieve, and is typically only possible a certain number of times.
The term "ROM" is sometimes used to refer to a ROM device containing specific software or a file with software to be stored in a writable ROM device. For example, users modifying or replacing theAndroid operating systemdescribe files containing a modified or replacement operating system as "custom ROMs" after the type of storage the file used to be written to, and they may distinguish between ROM (where software and data is stored, usuallyFlash memory) and RAM.
ROM and RAM are essential components of a computer, each serving distinct roles. RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a temporary, volatile storage medium that loses data when the system powers down. In contrast, ROM, being non-volatile, preserves its data even after the computer is switched off.
IBM used capacitor read-only storage (CROS) andtransformer read-only storage(TROS) to store microcode for the smallerSystem/360models, the360/85, and the initial twoSystem/370models (370/155and370/165). On some models there was also awriteable control store(WCS) for additional diagnostics and emulation support. TheApollo Guidance Computerusedcore rope memory, programmed by threading wires through magnetic cores.
The simplest type ofsolid-stateROM is as old as thesemiconductortechnology itself.Combinationallogic gatescan be joined manually to mapn-bit address input onto arbitrary values ofm-bit data output (alook-up table). With the invention of theintegrated circuitcamemask ROM. Mask ROM consists of a grid ofwordlines (the address input) and bit lines (the data output), selectively joined withtransistorswitches, and can represent an arbitrary look-up table with a regular physical layout and predictablepropagation delay. Mask ROM is programmed withphotomasksinphotolithographyduringsemiconductor manufacturing. The mask defines physical features or structures that will be removed, or added in the ROM chips, and the presence or absence of these features will represent either a 1 or a 0 bit, depending on the ROM design.Thus by design, any attempts to electronically change the data will fail, since the data is defined by the presence or absence of physical features or structures that cannot be electronically changed. For every software program, even for revisions of the same program, the entire mask must be changed, which can be costly.
In mask ROM, the data is physically encoded in the circuit, so it can only be programmed during fabrication. This leads to a number of serious disadvantages:
Subsequent developments have addressed these shortcomings.Programmable read-only memory(PROM), invented byWen Tsing Chowin 1956,allowed users to program its contents exactly once by physically altering its structure with the application of high-voltage pulses. This addressed problems 1 and 2 above, since a company can simply order a large batch of fresh PROM chips and program them with the desired contents at its designers' convenience.
The advent of themetal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor(MOSFET), invented atBell Labsin 1959,enabled the practical use ofmetal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS) transistors asmemory cellstorage elements insemiconductor memory, a function previously served bymagnetic coresincomputer memory.In 1967,Dawon KahngandSimon Szeof Bell Labs proposed that thefloating gateof a MOSsemiconductor devicecould be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM, which led toDov FrohmanofIntelinventingerasable programmable read-only memory(EPROM) in 1971.The 1971 invention of EPROM essentially solved problem 3, since EPROM (unlike PROM) can be repeatedly reset to its unprogrammed state by exposure to strong ultraviolet light.
Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory(EEPROM), developed by Yasuo Tarui, Yutaka Hayashi and Kiyoko Naga at theElectrotechnical Laboratoryin 1972,went a long way to solving problem 4, since an EEPROM can be programmedin-placeif the containing device provides a means to receive the program contents from an external source (for example, a personal computer via aserial cable).Flash memory, invented byFujio MasuokaatToshibain the early 1980s and commercialized in the late 1980s, is a form of EEPROM that makes very efficient use of chip area and can be erased and reprogrammed thousands of times without damage. It permits erasure and programming of only a specific part of the device, instead of the entire device. This can be done at high speed, hence the name "flash".
All of these technologies improved the flexibility of ROM, but at a significant cost-per-chip, so that in large quantities mask ROM would remain an economical choice for many years. (Decreasing cost of reprogrammable devices had almost eliminated the market for mask ROM by the year 2000.) Rewriteable technologies were envisioned as replacements for mask ROM.
The most recent development isNAND flash, also invented at Toshiba. Its designers explicitly broke from past practice, stating plainly that "the aim of NAND flash is to replacehard disks,"rather than the traditional use of ROM as a form of non-volatileprimary storage. As of 2021, NAND has nearly completely achieved this goal by offering throughput higher than hard disks, lower latency, higher tolerance of physical shock, extreme miniaturization (in the form ofUSB flash drivesand tinymicroSDmemory cards, for example), and much lower power consumption.
Manystored-program computersuse a form ofnon-volatile storage(that is, storage that retains its data when power is removed) to store the initial program that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution (a process knownasbootstrapping, often abbreviated to "booting" or "booting up"). Likewise, every non-trivial computer needs some form of mutable memory to record changes in itsstateas it executes.
Forms of read-only memory were employed as non-volatile storage for programs in most early stored-program computers, such asENIACafter 1948. (Until then it was not a stored-program computer as every program had to be manually wired into the machine, which could take days to weeks.) Read-only memory was simpler to implement since it needed only a mechanism to read stored values, and not to change them in-place, and thus could be implemented with very crude electromechanical devices (seehistorical examplesbelow). With the advent ofintegrated circuitsin the 1960s, both ROM and its mutable counterpartstatic RAMwere implemented as arrays oftransistorsin silicon chips; however, a ROM memory cell could be implemented using fewer transistors than an SRAM memory cell, since the latter needs alatch(comprising 5-20 transistors) to retain its contents, while a ROM cell might consist of the absence (logical 0) or presence (logical 1) of one transistor connecting a bit line to a word line.Consequently, ROM could be implemented at a lower cost-per-bitthan RAM for many years.
Mosthome computersof the 1980s stored aBASICinterpreter oroperating systemin ROM as other forms of non-volatile storage such asmagnetic diskdrives were too costly. For example, theCommodore 64included 64KBof RAM and 20 KB of ROM containing a BASIC interpreter and theKERNALoperating system. Later home or office computers such as theIBMPC XToften included magnetic disk drives, and larger amounts of RAM, allowing them to load their operating systems from disk into RAM, with only a minimal hardware initialization core andbootloaderremaining in ROM (known as theBIOSinIBM-compatiblecomputers). This arrangement allowed for a more complex and easily upgradeable operating system.
In modern PCs, "ROM" is used to store the basic bootstrappingfirmwarefor the processor, as well as the variousfirmwareneeded to internally control self-contained devices such asgraphic cards,hard disk drives,solid-state drives,optical disc drives,TFT screens, etc., in the system. Today, many of these "read-only" memories – especially theBIOS/UEFI– are often replaced withEEPROMorFlash memory(see below), to permit in-place reprogramming should the need for a firmware upgrade arise. However, simple and mature sub-systems (such as the keyboard or some communication controllers in the integrated circuits on the main board, for example) may employ mask ROM orOTP(one-time programmable).
ROM andsuccessor technologiessuch as flash are prevalent inembedded systems. These are in everything fromindustrial robotstohome appliancesandconsumer electronics(MP3 players,set-top boxes, etc.) all of which are designed for specific functions, but are based on general-purposemicroprocessors. With software usually tightly coupled to hardware, program changes are rarely needed in such devices (which typically lack hard disks for reasons of cost, size, or power consumption). As of 2008, most products use Flash rather than mask ROM, and many provide some means for connecting to a PC forfirmwareupdates; for example, a digital audio player might be updated to support a newfile format. Some hobbyists have taken advantage of this flexibility to reprogram consumer products for new purposes; for example, theiPodLinuxandOpenWrtprojects have enabled users to run full-featuredLinuxdistributionson their MP3 players and wireless routers, respectively.
ROM is also useful for binary storage ofcryptographicdata, as it makes them difficult to replace, which may be desirable in order to enhanceinformation security.
Since ROM (at least in hard-wired mask form) cannot be modified, it is only suitable for storing data which is not expected to need modification for the life of the device. To that end, ROM has been used in many computers to storelook-up tablesfor the evaluation of mathematical and logical functions (for example, afloating-point unitmighttabulate the sine functionin order to facilitate faster computation). This was especially effective whenCPUswere slow and ROM was cheap compared to RAM.
Notably, thedisplay adaptersof early personal computers stored tables of bitmapped font characters in ROM. This usually meant that the text displayfontcould not be changed interactively. This was the case for both theCGAandMDAadapters available with the IBM PC XT.
The use of ROM to store such small amounts of data has disappeared almost completely in modern general-purpose computers. However,NAND Flashhas taken over a new role as a medium formass storageorsecondary storageof files.
Mask ROMis a read-only memory whose contents are programmed by theintegrated circuitmanufacturer (rather than by the user). The desired memory contents are furnished by the customer to the device manufacturer. The desired data is converted into a customphotomask/mask layer for the final metallization of interconnections on the memory chip (hence the name).
Mask ROM can be made in several ways, all of which aim to change the electrical response of a transistor when it is addressed on a grid, such as:
Mask ROM transistors can be arranged in either NOR or NAND configurations and can achieve one of the smallest cell sizes possible as each bit is represented by only one transistor. NAND offers higher storage density than NOR. OR configurations are also possible, but compared to NOR it only connects transistors to Vccinstead of Vss.Mask ROMs used to be the most inexpensive, and are the simplest semiconductor memory devices, with only one metal layer and one polysilicon layer, making it the type of semiconductor memory with the highest manufacturing yield(the highest number of working devices per manufacturing run). ROM can be made using one of several semiconductor device fabrication technologies such asCMOS,nMOS,pMOS, andbipolar transistors.
It is common practice to use rewritablenon-volatile memory– such as UV-EPROMorEEPROM– for the development phase of a project, and to switch to mask ROM when the code has been finalized. For example,Atmelmicrocontrollers come in both EEPROM and mask ROM formats.
The main advantage of mask ROM is its cost. Per bit, mask ROM was more compact than any other kind ofsemiconductor memory. Since the cost of anintegrated circuitstrongly depends on its size, mask ROM is significantly cheaper than any other kind of semiconductor memory.
However, the one-time masking cost is high and there is a long turn-around time from design to product phase. Design errors are costly: if an error in the data or code is found, the mask ROM is useless and must be replaced in order to change the code or data.
As of 2003, four companies produce most such mask ROM chips:Samsung Electronics,NEC Corporation,Oki Electric Industry, andMacronix.
Some integrated circuits contain only mask ROM. Other integrated circuits contain mask ROM as well as a variety of other devices. In particular, manymicroprocessorshave mask ROM to store theirmicrocode. Somemicrocontrollershave mask ROM to store thebootloaderor all of theirfirmware.
Classic mask-programmed ROM chips are integrated circuits that physically encode the data to be stored, and thus it is impossible to change their contents after fabrication.
It is also possible to write the contents of a Laser ROM by using a laser to alter the electrical properties of only some diodes on the ROM, or by using a laser to cut only some polysilicon links, instead of using a mask.
By applyingwrite protection, some types of reprogrammable ROMs may temporarily become read-only memory.
There are other types of non-volatile memory which are not based on solid-state IC technology, including:
Although the relative speed of RAM vs. ROM has varied over time, as of 2007large RAM chips can be read faster than most ROMs. For this reason (and to allow uniform access), ROM content is sometimes copied to RAM orshadowedbefore its first use, and subsequently read from RAM.
For those types of ROM that can be electrically modified, writing speed has traditionally been much slower than reading speed, and it may need unusually high voltage, the movement of jumper plugs to apply write-enable signals, and special lock/unlock command codes. Modern NAND Flash can be used to achieve the highest write speeds of any rewritable ROM technology, with speeds as high as 10GB/sin an SSD. This has been enabled by the increased investment in both consumer and enterprise solid-state drives and flash memory products for higher end mobile devices. On a technical level the gains have been achieved by increasing parallelism both in controller design and of storage, the use of large DRAM read/write caches and the implementation of memory cells which can store more than one bit (DLC, TLC and MLC). The latter approach is more failure prone but this has been largely mitigated by overprovisioning (the inclusion of spare capacity in a product which is visible only to the drive controller) and by increasingly sophisticated read/write algorithms in drive firmware.
Because they are written by forcing electrons through a layer ofelectrical insulationonto afloating transistor gate, rewriteable ROMs can withstand only a limited number of write and erase cycles before the insulation is permanently damaged. In the earliest EPROMs, this might occur after as few as 1,000 write cycles, while in modern Flash EEPROM the endurance may exceed 1,000,000. The limited endurance, as well as the higher cost per bit, means that Flash-based storage is unlikely to completely supplant magneticdisk drivesin the near future.
The timespan over which a ROM remains accurately readable is not limited by write cycling. The data retention of EPROM, EAROM, EEPROM, and Flash may be time-limited by charge leaking from thefloating gatesof the memory cell transistors. Early generation EEPROM's, in the mid-1980s generally cited 5 or 6 year data retention. A review of EEPROM's offered in the year 2020 shows manufacturers citing 100 year data retention. Adverse environments will reduce the retention time (leakage is accelerated by high temperatures orradiation). Masked ROM and fuse/antifuse PROM do not suffer from this effect, as their data retention depends on physical rather than electrical permanence of the integrated circuit, although fuse re-growth was once a problem in some systems.
The contents of ROM chips can be extracted with special hardware devices and relevant controlling software. This practice is common for, as a main example, reading the contents of older videogame consolecartridges. Another example is making backups of firmware/OS ROMs from older computers or other devices - for archival purposes, as in many cases, the original chips are PROMs and thus at risk of exceeding their usable data lifetime.
The resultant memory dump files are known asROM imagesor abbreviatedROMs, and can be used to produce duplicate ROMs - for example to produce new cartridges or as digital files for playing inconsole emulators. The termROM imageoriginated when most console games were distributed on cartridges containing ROM chips, but achieved such widespread usage that it is still applied to images of newer games distributed onCD-ROMsor other optical media.
ROM images of commercial games, firmware, etc. usually contain copyrighted software. The unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted software is a violation ofcopyrightlaws in many jurisdictions, although duplication forbackuppurposes may be consideredfair usedepending on location. In any case, there is a thriving community engaged in the distribution and trading of such software for preservation/sharing purposes.
