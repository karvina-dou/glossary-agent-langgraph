Apersonal computer, often referred to as aPCor simplycomputer, is acomputerdesigned for individual use.It is typically used for tasks such asword processing,internet browsing,email,multimediaplayback, andgaming. Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by anend user, rather than by a computer expert ortechnician. Unlike large, costlyminicomputersandmainframes,time-sharingby many people at the same time is not used with personal computers. The termhome computerhas also been used, primarily in the late 1970s and 1980s. The advent of personal computers and the concurrentDigital Revolutionhave significantly affected the lives of people.
Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with computers. While personal computer users may develop their applications, usually these systems runcommercial software, free-of-charge software ("freeware"), which is most often proprietary, orfree and open-source software, which is provided inready-to-run, orbinaryform. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware oroperating systemmanufacturers.Many personal computer users no longer need to write their programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts with mobile systems, where software is often available only through a manufacturer-supported channel,and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.
Since the early 1990s,Microsoftoperating systems (first withMS-DOSand then withWindows) and CPUs based onIntel'sx86architecture – collectively calledWintel– have dominated the personal computer market, and today the term PC normally refers to the ubiquitous Wintel platform, or to Windows PCs in general (including those running ARM chips), to the point where software for Windows is marketed as "for PC".Alternatives to Windows occupy a minority share of the market; these include theMacplatform fromApple(running themacOSoperating system), andfree and open-source,Unix-likeoperating systems, such asLinux(including the Linux-derivedChromeOS). Other notable platforms until the 1990s were theAmigafromCommodore, theAtari ST, and thePC-98fromNEC.
The term 'PC' is aninitialismfor 'personal computer'. While theIBM Personal Computerincorporated the designation into its model name, the term originally described personal computers of any brand. In some contexts, PC is used to contrast with Mac, anApple Macintoshcomputer.
Since none of these Apple products were mainframes or time-sharing systems, they were all personal computers but not PC (brand) computers. In 1995, a CBS segment on the growing popularity of PC reported: "For many newcomers PC stands for Pain and Confusion."
The "brain" [computer] may one day come down to our level [of the common people] and help with our income-tax and book-keeping calculations. But this is speculation and there is no sign of it so far.
In thehistory of computing, early experimental machines could be operated by a single attendant. For example,ENIACwhich became operational in 1946 could be run by a single, albeit highly trained, person.This mode pre-dated the batch programming, or time-sharing modes with multiple users connected throughterminalsto mainframe computers. Computers intended for laboratory, instrumentation, or engineering purposes were built, and could be operated by one person in an interactive fashion. Examples include such systems as theBendix G15andLGP-30of 1956, and the SovietMIRseries of computers developed from 1965 to 1969.By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single-person use of acomputer systemin interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person.
The personal computer was made possible by major advances insemiconductortechnology. In 1959, thesiliconintegrated circuit(IC) chip was developed byRobert NoyceatFairchild Semiconductor,and themetal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS) transistor was developed byMohamed AtallaandDawon KahngatBell Labs.The MOS integrated circuit was commercialized byRCAin 1964,and then thesilicon-gateMOS integrated circuit was developed byFederico Fagginat Fairchild in 1968.Faggin later used silicon-gate MOS technology to develop the first single-chipmicroprocessor, theIntel 4004, in 1971.The firstmicrocomputers, based on microprocessors, were developed during the early 1970s. Widespread commercial availability of microprocessors, from the mid-1970s onwards, made computers cheap enough for small businesses and individuals to own.
In what was later to be calledthe Mother of All Demos,SRIresearcherDouglas Engelbartin 1968 gave a preview of features that would later become staples of personal computers:e-mail,hypertext,word processing,video conferencing, and themouse. The demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time-sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time.
Early personal computers‍—‌generally called microcomputers‍—‌were often sold in akitform and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided byfront panellamps. Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards,computer displays,disk drives, andprinters.
Micral Nwas the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, theIntel 8008. It was built starting in 1972, and a few hundred units were sold. This had been preceded by theDatapoint 2200in 1970, for which the Intel 8008 had been commissioned, though not accepted for use. The CPU design implemented in the Datapoint 2200 became the basis forx86architectureused in the originalIBM PCand its descendants.
In 1973, theIBMLos Gatos Scientific Center developed aportable computerprototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on theIBM PALMprocessor with aPhilipscompact cassette drive, smallCRT, and full function keyboard. SCAMP emulated anIBM 1130minicomputer in order to run APL/1130.In 1973,APLwas generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as theWang 2200orHP 9800offered onlyBASIC. Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL/1130 performance on a portable, single user computer,PC Magazinein 1983 designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer".This seminal, single userportable computernow resides in theSmithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.. Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to theIBM 5100portable microcomputer launched in 1975 with the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians, and other business problem-solvers. In the late 1960s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton.
Another desktop portable APL machine, theMCM/70, was demonstrated in 1973 and shipped in 1974. It used theIntel 8008processor.
A seminal step in personal computing was the 1973Xerox Alto, developed atXerox'sPalo Alto Research Center (PARC). It had a graphical user interface (GUI) which later served as inspiration for Apple'sMacintosh, and Microsoft'sWindowsoperating system. The Alto was a demonstration project, not commercialized, as the parts were too expensive to be affordable.
Also in 1973Hewlett Packardintroduced fullyBASICprogrammable microcomputers that fit entirely on top of a desk, including a keyboard, a small one-line display, and printer. TheWang 2200microcomputer of 1973 had a full-sizecathode ray tube(CRT) and cassette tape storage.These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses.
1974 saw the introduction of what is considered by many to be the first true personal computer, theAltair 8800created byMicro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).Based on the 8-bitIntel 8080Microprocessor,the Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited themicrocomputer revolutionas the first commercially successful personal computer.Thecomputer busdesigned for the Altair was to become ade factostandardin the form of theS-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft's founding product,Altair BASIC.
In 1976,Steve JobsandSteve Wozniaksold theApple Icomputer circuit board, which was fully prepared and contained about 30 chips. The Apple I computer differed from the other kit-style hobby computers of era. At the request ofPaul Terrell, owner of theByte Shop, Jobs and Wozniak were given their first purchase order, for 50 Apple I computers, only if the computers were assembled and tested and not a kit computer. Terrell wanted to have computers to sell to a wide range of users, not just experienced electronics hobbyists who had the soldering skills to assemble a computer kit. TheApple Ias delivered was still technically a kit computer, as it did not have a power supply, case, or keyboard when it was delivered to the Byte Shop.
The first successfully mass-marketed personal computer to be announced was theCommodore PETafter being revealed in January 1977. However, it was back-ordered and not available until later that year.Three months later (April), theApple II(usually referred to as the Apple) was announced with the first units being shipped 10 June 1977,and theTRS-80fromTandy Corporation/Tandy Radio Shackfollowing in August 1977, which sold over 100,000 units during its lifetime. Together, especially in the North American market, these 3 machines were referred to as the "1977 trinity". Mass-market, ready-assembled computers had arrived, and allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.
In 1977 the Heath company introduced personal computer kits known asHeathkits, starting with theHeathkit H8, followed by the Heathkit H89 in late 1979. With the purchase of the Heathkit H8 you would obtain the chassis and CPU card to assemble yourself, additional hardware such as the H8-1 memory board that contained 4k of RAM could also be purchased in order to run software. The Heathkit H11 model was released in 1978 and was one of the first 16-bit personal computers; however, due to its high retail cost of $1,295 was discontinued in 1982.
During the early 1980s,home computerswere further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display, with low-detail blocky graphics and a limited color range, and text about 40 characters wide by 25 characters tall.Sinclair Research,a UK company, produced the ZX Series‍—‌theZX80(1980),ZX81(1981), and theZX Spectrum; the latter was introduced in 1982, and totaled 8 million unit sold. Following came theCommodore 64, totaled 17 million units sold,theGalaksija(1983)introduced inYugoslaviaand theAmstrad CPCseries (464–6128).
In the same year, theNEC PC-98was introduced, which was a very popular personal computer that sold in more than 18 million units.Another famous personal computer, the revolutionaryAmiga 1000, was unveiled byCommodoreon 23 July 1985. The Amiga 1000 featured a multitasking, windowing operating system, color graphics with a 4096-color palette, stereo sound, Motorola 68000 CPU, 256 KB RAM, and 880 KB 3.5-inch disk drive, for US$1,295.
IBM's first PC was introduced on 12 August 1981 setting what became a mass market standard for PC architecture.
In 1982The Computerwas namedMachine of the YearbyTimemagazine.
Somewhat larger and more expensive systems were aimed at office and small business use. These often featured 80-column text displays but might not have had graphics or sound capabilities. These microprocessor-based systems were still less costly than time-shared mainframes or minicomputers.
Workstationswere characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large-capacity local disk storage, networking capability, and running under amultitasking operating system. Eventually, due to theinfluence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market, personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.
An increasingly important set of uses for personal computers relied on the ability of the computer to communicate with other computer systems, allowing interchange of information. Experimental public access to a shared mainframe computer system was demonstrated as early as 1973 in theCommunity Memoryproject, butbulletin board systemsandonline service providersbecame more commonly available after 1978. CommercialInternetservice providers emerged in the late 1980s, giving public access to the rapidly growing network.
In 1984,Apple Computerlaunched theMacintosh, with anadvertisement during the Super Bowl. The Macintosh was the first successful mass-marketmouse-driven computer with agraphical user interfaceor 'WIMP' (Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointers). Based on theMotorola 68000microprocessor, the Macintosh included many of the Lisa's features at a price of US$2,495. The Macintosh was introduced with 128 KB of RAM and later that year a 512 KB RAM model became available. To reduce costs compared the Lisa, the year-younger Macintosh had a simplified motherboard design, no internal hard drive, and a single 3.5-inch floppy drive.  Applications that came with the Macintosh includedMacPaint, a bit-mapped graphics program, andMacWrite, which demonstratedWYSIWYGword processing.
The Macintosh was a successful personal computer for years to come. This is particularly due to the introduction ofdesktop publishingin 1985 through Apple's partnership withAdobe. This partnership introduced theLaserWriterprinter andAldus PageMakerto users of the personal computer. DuringSteve Jobs's hiatus from Apple, a number of different models of Macintosh, including theMacintosh PlusandMacintosh II, were released to a great degree of success. The entire Macintosh line of computers was IBM's major competition up until the early 1990s.
In 1991, theWorld Wide Webwas made available for public use. The combination of powerful personal computers with high-resolution graphics and sound, with the infrastructure provided by the Internet, and the standardization of access methods of theWeb browsers, established the foundation for a significant fraction of modern life, from bus time tables through unlimited distribution of free videos through to online user-edited encyclopedias.
A workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical, mathematical, or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to alocal area networkand run multi-useroperating systems. Workstations are used for tasks such ascomputer-aided design, drafting and modeling, computation-intensive scientific and engineering calculations, image processing,architecturalmodeling, andcomputer graphicsfor animation and motion picture visual effects.
Before the widespread use of PCs, a computer that could fit on adeskwas remarkably small, leading to thedesktopnomenclature. More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style ofcomputer case. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large verticaltower casesto small models which can be tucked behind or rest directly beneath (and support)LCD monitors.
While the termdesktopoften refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computertower case, these varieties often rest on the ground or underneath desks. Despite this seeming contradiction, the termdesktopdoes typically refer to these vertical tower cases as well as the horizontally aligned models which are designed to literally rest on top of desks and are therefore more appropriate to thedesktopterm, although both types qualify for thisdesktoplabel in most practical situations aside from certain physical arrangement differences. Both styles of these computer cases hold the systems hardwarecomponentssuch as themotherboard, processor chip and other internal operating parts. Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and an external keyboard, which are plugged into ports on the back of the computer case. Desktop computers are popular for home and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk formultiple monitors.
Agaming computeris a desktop computer that generally comprises a high-performancevideo card, processor and RAM, to improve the speed and responsiveness of demandingvideo games.
Anall-in-one computer(also known as single-unit PCs) is a desktop computer that combines the monitor and processor within a single unit. A separate keyboard and mouse are standard input devices, with some monitors includingtouchscreencapability. The processor and other working components are typically reduced in size relative to standard desktops, located behind the monitor, and configured similarly to laptops.
Anettopcomputer was introduced byIntelin February 2008, characterized by low cost and lean functionality. These were intended to be used with an Internet connection to runWebbrowsers and Internet applications.
AHome theater PC(HTPC) combines the functions of a personal computer and adigital video recorder. It is connected to aTV setor an appropriately sizedcomputer display, and is often used as a digital photo viewer, music and video player, TV receiver, and digital video recorder. HTPCs are also referred to as media center systems ormedia servers. The goal is to combine many or all components of ahome theatersetup into one box. HTPCs can also connect to services providing on-demand movies and TV shows. HTPCs can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be assembled from components.
Keyboard computersare computers inside of keyboards, generally still designed to be connected to an externalcomputer monitorortelevision. Examples include theAtari ST,Amstrad CPC,BBC Micro,Commodore 64,MSX,Raspberry Pi 400, and theZX Spectrum.
The potential utility ofportable computerswas apparent early on.Alan Kaydescribed theDynabookin 1972, but no hardware was developed. TheXerox NoteTakerwas produced in a very small experimental batch around 1978. In 1975, theIBM 5100could be fit into a transport case, making it a portable computer, but it weighed about 50 pounds. Such early portable computers were termedluggablesby journalists owing to their heft.
Before the introduction of the IBM PC, portable computers consisting of a processor, display, disk drives and keyboard, in a suit-case style portable housing, allowed users to bring a computer home from the office or to take notes at a classroom. Examples include theOsborne 1andKaypro; and theCommodore SX-64. These machines were AC-powered and included a small CRT display screen. The form factor was intended to allow these systems to be taken on board an airplane as carry-on baggage, though their high power demand meant that they could not be used in flight. The integrated CRT display made for a relatively heavy package, but these machines were more portable than their contemporary desktop equals. Some models had standard or optional connections to drive an external video monitor, allowing a larger screen or use with video projectors.
IBM PC-compatible suitcase format computers became available soon after the introduction of the PC, with theCompaq Portablebeing a leading example of the type. Later models included ahard driveto give roughly equivalent performance to contemporary desktop computers.
The development of thin plasma display and LCD screens permitted a somewhat smaller form factor, called thelunchboxcomputer. The screen formed one side of the enclosure, with a detachable keyboard and one or two half-height floppy disk drives, mounted facing the ends of the computer. Some variations included a battery, allowing operation away from AC outlets.
Alaptopcomputer is designed for portability withclamshelldesign, where the keyboard and computer components are on one panel, with a hinged second panel containing a flat display screen. Closing the laptop protects the screen and keyboard during transportation. Laptops generally have a rechargeablebattery, enhancing their portability. To save power, weight and space, laptop graphics chips are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to desktop machines, that more typically have a graphics card installed. For this reason, desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops forgamingpurposes.
Unlike desktop computers, only minor internal upgrades (such as memory and hard disk drive) are feasible owing to the limited space and power available. Laptops have the same input and output ports as desktops, for connecting to external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards. Laptops are also a little more expensive compared to desktops, as the miniaturized components for laptops themselves are expensive.
Notebook computerssuch as theTRS-80 Model 100andEpson HX-20had roughly the plan dimensions of a sheet of typing paper (ANSI A or ISO A4). These machines had a keyboard with slightly reduced dimensions compared to a desktop system, and a fixed LCD display screen coplanar with the keyboard. These displays were usually small, with 8 to 16 lines of text, sometimes only 40 columns line length. However, these machines could operate for extended times on disposable or rechargeable batteries. Although they did not usually include internal disk drives, this form factor often included amodemfor telephone communication and often had provisions for external cassette or disk storage. Later, clamshell format laptop computers with similar small plan dimensions were also callednotebooks.
Adesktop replacement computeris a portable computer that provides the full capabilities of adesktop computer. Such computers are currently large laptops. This class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers, and may have limited battery capacity or no battery.
Netbooks, also called mini notebooks orsubnotebooks, were a subgroup of laptopssuited for general computing tasks and accessingweb-based applications. Initially, the primary defining characteristic of netbooks was the lack of anoptical discdrive, smaller size, and lower performance than full-size laptops. By mid-2009 netbooks had been offered to users "free of charge", with an extended service contract purchase of a cellular data plan.UltrabooksandChromebookshave since filled the gap left by Netbooks. Unlike the generic Netbook name, Ultrabook and Chromebook are technically both specifications by Intel and Google respectively.
Atabletuses atouchscreendisplay, which can be controlled using either astyluspen or finger. Some tablets may use ahybridorconvertibledesign, offering a keyboard that can either be removed as an attachment, or a screen that can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard. Some tablets may use desktop-PC operating system such as Windows or Linux, or may run an operating system designed primarily for tablets. Many tablet computers have USB ports, to which a keyboard or mouse can be connected.
Smartphonesare often similar totablet computers, the difference being that smartphones always havecellularintegration. They are generally smaller than tablets, and may not have a slate form factor.
The ultra-mobile PC (UMPC) is a smalltablet computer. It was developed byMicrosoft,IntelandSamsung, among others. Current UMPCs typically feature the Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Linuxoperating system, and low-voltageIntel AtomorVIA C7-Mprocessors.
A pocket PC is a hardware specification for a handheld-sized computer (personal digital assistant, PDA) that runs theMicrosoftWindows Mobileoperating system. It may have the capability to run an alternativeoperating systemlikeNetBSDorLinux. Pocket PCs have many of the capabilities of desktopPCs. Numerousapplicationsare available for handhelds adhering to the Microsoft Pocket PC specification, many of which arefreeware. Microsoft-compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons likeGPS receivers,barcodereaders,RFIDreaders and cameras.
In 2007, with the release of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme: devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC, while devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional.
Palmtop PCswere miniature pocket-sized computers runningDOSthat first came about in the late 1980s, typically in a clamshell form factor with a keyboard. Non-x86 based devices were often called palmtop computers, examples beingPsion Series 3. In later years a hardware specification calledHandheld PCwas later released by Microsoft that run theWindows CEoperating system.
Computer hardwareis a comprehensive term for all physical and tangible parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. Some sub-systems of a personal computer may contain processors that run a fixed program, orfirmware, such as a keyboard controller. Firmware usually is not changed by the end user of the personal computer.
Most 2010s and 2020s-era personal computers require users only to plug in the power supply, monitor, and other cables. A typicaldesktop computerconsists of acomputer case(ortower), a metal chassis that holds thepower supply,motherboard, a storage device such as ahard disk driveorsolid-state drive, and often anoptical disc drive. Most towers have empty space where users can add additional components. External devices such as acomputer monitororvisual display unit,keyboard, and apointing device(mouse) are usually found in a personal computer.
Themotherboardconnects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. TheRAM, graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard. Thecentral processing unit(microprocessor chip) plugs into aCPU socket, while the ram modules plug into corresponding ram sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard, while others useexpansion slotsfor graphics cards, network cards, or otherinput/outputdevices. The graphics card or sound card may employ abreak out boxto keep the analog parts away from theelectromagnetic radiationinside the computer case. Disk drives, which provide mass storage, are connected to the motherboard with one cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually, disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage.
For large amounts of data, atape drivecan be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case. The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer case. The monitor is also connected to the input/output (I/O) panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card. Capabilities of the personal computer's hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition ofexpansion cardsconnected via an expansionbus. Standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers includePCI,PCI Express(PCIe), andAGP(a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters, found in older computers). Most modern personal computers have multiple physical PCI Express expansion slots, with some having PCI slots as well.
Aperipheralis "a device connected to a computer to provide communication (such as input and output) or auxiliary functions (such as additional storage)".Peripherals generally connect to the computer through the use of USB ports or inputs located on the I/O panel.USB flash drivesprovide portable storage using flash memory which allows users to access the files stored on the drive on any computer.Memory cardsalso provide portable storage for users, commonly used on other electronics such as mobile phones and digital cameras, the information stored on these cards can be accessed using a memory card reader to transfer data between devices. Webcams, which are either built into computer hardware or connected via USB are video cameras that records video in real time to either be saved to the computer or streamed somewhere else over the internet.Game controllerscan be plugged in via USB and can be used as an input device for video games as an alternative to using keyboard and mouse.Headphonesand speakers can be connected via USB or through an auxiliary port (found on I/O panel) and allow users to listen to audio accessed on their computer; however, speakers may also require an additional power source to operate.Microphonescan be connected through an audio input port on the I/O panel and allow the computer to convert sound into an electrical signal to be used or transmitted by the computer.
Computer software is any kind ofcomputer program,procedure, or documentation that performs some task on a computer system.The term includesapplication softwaresuch asword processorsthat perform productive tasks for users,system softwaresuch asoperating systemsthat interface withcomputer hardwareto provide the necessary services for application software, andmiddlewarethat controls and co-ordinatesdistributed systems.
Software applications are common forword processing,Internetbrowsing,Internet faxing,e-mailand other digital messaging,multimediaplayback, playing ofcomputer game, andcomputer programming. The user may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, mostsoftwarewritten primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, oruser-friendlinessin mind. However, thesoftware industrycontinuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.
An operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with aninterfaceused to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocatingmemory, prioritizing system requests, controllinginput/outputdevices, facilitatingcomputer networking, and managing files.
Common contemporary desktop operating systems areMicrosoft Windows,macOS,Linux,SolarisandFreeBSD. Windows, macOS, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of them were inspired by or directly inherited from theUnixoperating system.
Early personal computers used operating systems that supportedcommand lineinteraction, using an alphanumeric display and keyboard. The user had to remember a large range of commands to, for example, open a file for editing or to move text from one place to another. Starting in the early 1960s, the advantages of agraphical user interfacebegan to be explored, but widespread adoption required lower-cost graphical display equipment. By 1984, mass-market computer systems using graphical user interfaces were available; by the turn of the 21st century, text-mode operating systems were no longer a significant fraction of the personal computer market.
Generally, a computer user uses application software to carry out a specific task.System softwaresupports applicationsand provides common services such as memory management, network connectivity and device drivers, all of which may be used by applications but are not directly of interest to the end user. A simplifiedanalogyin the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb (an application) to an electric power generation plant (a system):the power plant merely generates electricity, not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user.
Typical examples of software applications areword processors,spreadsheets, andmedia players. Multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as anapplication suite.Microsoft OfficeandLibreOffice,which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several other discrete applications, are typical examples.The separate applications in a suite usually have auser interfacethat has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application. Often, they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user; for example, a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application.
End-user developmenttailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software include spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts; even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.
PC gamingis popular among the high-end PC market. According to an April 2018 market analysis done byNewzoo, PC gaming was the third largest gaming sector behind console and mobile gaming in terms of market share sitting at a 24% share of the entire market. The market for PC gaming continues to grow and is expected to generate $32.3 billion in revenue in the year 2021.PC gaming is at the forefront of competitive gaming, known asesports, with games such asLeague of Legends,ValorantandCounter-Strike: Global Offensiveleading the industry that is suspected to surpass a billion dollars in revenue in 2019.According to a December 2023 market analysis done byVisual Capitalist, the PC gaming sector was the second-largest category across all platforms as of 2022, valued at US$45 billion, surpassing console market revenue by 2020.
There are multiple different game distributors; players are able to purchase games in-person at retail stores and digitally. Some large names for digital game distributors areEpic Games,Valve Corporation,Electronic Arts, andUbisoft. Distributors such as the ones listed allow many games to be purchasable and accessible to users.Though some distributors may only sell games that have been created by their own company, many games and franchises are available on multiple distributor platforms. Some multiplayer pc games can also becross-platform, allowing players the ability the play with other platforms, such as pc and different consoles. There aregameson distributor platforms that may allow players to play other known games using the game application as anemulator;these games originally may not be supported by the player's current device, whether it be platform locked or no longer supported by theoperating systemof the pc. The number of differentvideo game genrescan range across each distributor platform,first-person shooters,MMO games,adventure games, etc. Many games, frequently free-to-play games, have microtransactions available for players. These transactions can help enhance gameplay or to personalize their characters.There are games such asThe Simsthat allow players to purchase additional game packs in order to gain access to additional new gameplay.
In 2001, 125 million personal computers were shipped in comparison to 48,000 in 1977.More than 500 million personal computers were in use in 2002 and onebillionpersonal computers had been sold worldwide from the mid-1970s up to this time. Of the latter figure, 75% were professional or work related, while the rest were sold for personal or home use. About 81.5% of personal computers shipped had beendesktop computers, 16.4%laptopsand 2.1%servers. The United States had received 38.8% (394 million) of the computers shipped, Europe 25% and 11.7% had gone to the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest-growing market as of 2002. The second billion was expected to be sold by 2008.Almost half of all households inWestern Europehad a personal computer and a computer could be found in 40% of homes in United Kingdom, compared with only 13% in 1985.
The global personal computer shipments were 350.9 million units in 2010,308.3 million units in 2009and 302.2 million units in 2008.The shipments were 264 million units in the year 2007, according toiSuppli,up 11.2% from 239 million in 2006.In 2004, the global shipments were 183 million units, an 11.6% increase over 2003.In 2003, 152.6 million computers were shipped, at an estimated value of $175 billion.In 2002, 136.7 million PCs were shipped, at an estimated value of $175 billion.In 2000, 140.2 million personal computers were shipped, at an estimated value of $226 billion.Worldwide shipments of personal computers surpassed the 100-million mark in 1999, growing to 113.5 million units from 93.3 million units in 1998.In 1999, Asia had 14.1 million units shipped.
As of June 2008, the number of personal computers in use worldwide hit one billion,while another billion is expected to be reached by 2014. Mature markets like the United States,Western Europeand Japan accounted for 58% of the worldwide installed PCs. Theemerging marketswere expected to double their installed PCs by 2012 and to take 70% of the second billion PCs. About 180 million computers (16% of the existing installed base) were expected to be replaced and 35 million to be dumped into landfill in 2008. The whole installed base grew 12% annually.
Based onInternational Data Corporation(IDC) data for Q2 2011, for the first time China surpassed US in PC shipments by 18.5 million and 17.7 million respectively. This trend reflects the rising of emerging markets as well as the relative stagnation of mature regions.
In thedeveloped world, there has been a vendor tradition to keep adding functions to maintain high prices of personal computers. However, since the introduction of theOne Laptop per Childfoundation and its low-costXO-1laptop, the computing industry started to pursue the price too. Although introduced only one year earlier, there were 14 millionnetbookssold in 2008.Besides the regular computer manufacturers, companies making especially rugged versions of computers have sprung up, offering alternatives for people operating their machines in extreme weather or environments.
In 2011,Deloitteconsulting firm predicted that,smartphonesandtablet computersas computing devices would surpass the PCs sales(as has happened since 2012). As of 2013, worldwide sales of PCs had begun to fall as many consumers moved to tablets and smartphones. Sales of 90.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2012 represented a 4.9% decline from sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.Global PC sales fell sharply in the first quarter of 2013, according to IDC data. The 14% year-over-year decline was the largest on record since the firm began tracking in 1994, and double what analysts had been expecting.The decline of Q2 2013 PC shipments marked the fifth straight quarter of falling sales."This is horrific news for PCs", remarked an analyst. "It's all about mobile computing now. We have definitely reached the tipping point."Data fromGartnershowed a similar decline for the same time period.China'sLenovo Groupbucked the general trend as strong sales to first-time buyers in the developing world allowed the company's sales to stay flat overall.Windows 8, which was designed to look similar to tablet/smartphone software, was cited as a contributing factor in the decline of new PC sales. "Unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only didn't provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market," said IDC Vice President Bob O'Donnell.
In August 2013, Credit Suisse published research findings that attributed around 75% of the operating profit share of the PC industry to Microsoft (operating system) and Intel (semiconductors).According to IDC, in 2013 PC shipments dropped by 9.8% as the greatest drop-ever in line with consumers trends to use mobile devices.
In the second quarter of 2018, PC sales grew for the first time since the first quarter of 2012. According to research firm Gartner, the growth mainly came from the business market while the consumer market experienced decline.
In 2020, as the result of theCOVID-19 Pandemicwith more people working at home and learning remotely, PC sales grew by 26.1% compared to previous years according toIDC.According to Canalys, 2020 was the highest growth rate for the PC market since 2011.
Selling prices of personal computers steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture, while the capabilities of computers increased. In 1975, an Altair kit sold for around onlyUS$400, but required customers to solder components into circuit boards; peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another$2,000, and the resultant system was of use only to hobbyists.
At their introduction in 1981, theUS$1,795price of theOsborne 1and its competitorKayprowas considered an attractive price point; these systems had text-only displays and only floppy disks for storage. By 1982,Michael Dellobserved that a personal computer system selling at retail for aboutUS$3,000was made of components that cost the dealer about$600; typical gross margin on a computer unit was around$1,000.The total value of personal computer purchases in the US in 1983 was about$4 billion, comparable to total sales ofpet food. By late 1998, the average selling price of personal computer systems in the United States had dropped below$1,000.
ForMicrosoft Windowssystems, theaverage selling price(ASP) showed a decline in 2008/2009, possibly due to low-costnetbooks, drawing$569fordesktop computersand $689 forlaptopsat U.S. retail in August 2008. In 2009, ASP had further fallen to$533for desktops and to$602for notebooks by January and to$540 and 560in February.According to research firmNPD, the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from$659in October 2008 to$519in October 2009.
External costs of environmental impact are not fully included in the selling price of personal computers.
Personal computers have become a large contributor to the 50 million tons of discarded electronic waste generated annually, according to theUnited Nations Environment Programme. To address theelectronic wasteissue affecting developing countries and the environment,extended producer responsibility (EPR)acts have been implemented in various countries and states.In the absence of comprehensive national legislation or regulation on the export and import of electronic waste, theSilicon Valley Toxics Coalitionand BAN (Basel Action Network) teamed up with electronic recyclers in the US and Canada to create an e-steward program for the orderly disposal of electronic waste. Some organizations oppose EPR regulation, and claim that manufacturers naturally move toward reduced material and energy use.
