TheRouting Information Protocol(RIP) is one of the oldestdistance-vector routing protocolswhich employs thehop countas arouting metric. RIP preventsrouting loopsby implementing a limit on the number ofhopsallowed in a path from source to destination. The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support.
RIP implements thesplit horizon,route poisoning, andholddownmechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.
In RIPv1 routers broadcast updates with their routing table every 30 seconds. In the early deployments,routing tableswere small enough that the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times.
In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice ofrouting protocol, as itstime to convergeandscalabilityare poor compared toEIGRP,OSPF, orIS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters, unlike other protocols.
RIP uses theUser Datagram Protocol(UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reservedport number520.
Based on theBellman–Ford algorithmand theFord–Fulkerson algorithm,distance-vector routing protocolsstarted to be implemented from 1969 onwards indata networkssuch as theARPANETandCYCLADES. The predecessor of RIP was the Gateway Information Protocol (GWINFO) which was developed byXeroxin the mid-1970s to route its experimental network. As part of theXerox Network Systems(XNS) protocol suite GWINFO transformed into the XNS Routing Information Protocol. This XNS RIP in turn became the basis for early routing protocols, such asNovell's IPX RIP,AppleTalk's Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and the IP RIP. The 1982Berkeley Software Distributionof theUNIXoperating system implemented RIP in therouteddaemon. The 4.2BSD release proved popular and became the basis for subsequent UNIX versions, which implemented RIP in theroutedorgateddaemon. Ultimately, RIP had been extensively deployedbefore the standard, written by Charles Hedrick, was passed as RIPv1 in 1988.
The routing metric used by RIP counts the number of routers that need to be passed to reach a destination IP network. The hop count 0 denotes a network that is directly connected to the router. 16 hops denote a network that is unreachable, according to the RIP hop limit.
There are three standardized versions of the Routing Information Protocol:RIPv1andRIPv2forIPv4, andRIPngforIPv6.
The original specification of RIP was published in 1988.When starting up, and every 30 seconds thereafter, a router with RIPv1 implementationbroadcaststo255.255.255.255a request message through every RIPv1 enabled interface. Neighbouring routers receiving the request message respond with a RIPv1 segment, containing theirrouting table. The requesting router updates its own routing table, with the reachable IP network address, hop count and next hop, that is the router interface IP address from which the RIPv1 response was sent. As the requesting router receives updates from different neighbouring routers it will only update the reachable networks in its routing table, if it receives information about a reachable network it has not yet in its routing table or information that a network it has in its routing table is reachable with a lower hop count. Therefore, a RIPv1 router will in most cases only have one entry for a reachable network, the one with the lowest hop count. If a router receives information from two different neighbouring router that the same network is reachable with the same hop count but via two different routes, the network will be entered into the routing table two times with different next hop routers. The RIPv1 enabled router will then perform what is known as equal-cost load balancing for IP packets.
RIPv1 enabled routers not only request the routing tables of other routers every 30 seconds, they also listen to incoming requests from neighbouring routers and send their own routing table in turn. RIPv1 routing tables are therefore updated every 25 to 35 seconds.The RIPv1 protocol adds a small random time variable to the update time, to avoid routing tables synchronizing across a LAN.It was thought, as a result of random initialization, the routing updates would spread out in time, but this was not true in practice. Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson showed in 1994 that, without slight randomization of the update timer, the timers synchronized over time.
RIPv1 can be configured into silent mode, so that a router requests and processes neighbouring routing tables, and keeps its routing table and hop count for reachable networks up to date, but does not needlessly send its own routing table into the network. Silent mode is commonly implemented to hosts.
RIPv1 usesclassfulrouting. The periodic routing updates do not carrysubnetinformation, lacking support forvariable length subnet masks(VLSM). This limitation makes it impossible to have different-sizedsubnetsinside of the samenetwork class. In other words, all subnets in a network class must have the same size. There is also no support for router authentication, making RIP vulnerable to various attacks.
Due to the deficiencies of the original RIP specification, RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed in 1993,published in 1994,and declaredInternet Standard56 in 1998.It included the ability to carry subnet information, thus supportingClassless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR). To maintain backward compatibility, the hop count limit of 15 remained. RIPv2 has facilities to fully interoperate with the earlier specification if allMust Be Zeroprotocol fields in the RIPv1 messages are properly specified. In addition, acompatibility switchfeatureallows fine-grained interoperability adjustments.
In an effort to avoid unnecessary load on hosts that do not participate in routing, RIPv2multicaststhe entire routing table to all adjacent routers at the address224.0.0.9, as opposed to RIPv1 which usesbroadcast.Unicastaddressing is still allowed for special applications.
(MD5) authentication for RIP was introduced in 1997.
Route tags were also added in RIP version 2. This functionality allows a distinction between routes learned from the RIP protocol and routes learned from other protocols.
RIPng (RIP next generation) is an extension of RIPv2 for support ofIPv6, the next generation Internet Protocol.The main differences between RIPv2 and RIPng are:
RIPng sends updates on UDP port 521 using the multicast groupff02::9.
RIP messages use theUser Datagram Protocolon port 520 and all RIP messages exchanged between routers are encapsulated in a UDP datagram.
RIP defined two types of messages:
The routing information protocol uses the following timers as part of its operation:
Cisco's proprietaryInterior Gateway Routing Protocol(IGRP) was a somewhat more capable protocol than RIP. It belongs to the same basic family ofdistance-vector routing protocols.
Cisco has ceased support and distribution of IGRP in their router software. It was replaced by theEnhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP) which is a completely new design. While EIGRP still uses a distance-vector model, it relates to IGRP only in using the same composite routing metric. Both IGRP and EIGRP calculated a single composite metric for each route, from a formula of five variables:bandwidth,delay,reliability,load, andMTU; though on Cisco routers, by default, only bandwidth and delay are used in this calculation.
