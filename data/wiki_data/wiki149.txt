TheWorld Wide Web(WWWor simply theWeb) is aninformation systemthat enablescontentsharing over theInternetthrough user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyondITspecialists and hobbyists.It allows documents and otherweb resourcesto be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of theHypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP).
The Web was invented by English computer scientistTim Berners-Leewhile atCERNin 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".Documents and other media content are made available to the network throughweb serversand can be accessed by programs such asweb browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings calleduniform resource locators(URLs).
The original and still very common document type is aweb pageformatted inHypertext Markup Language(HTML). This markup language supportsplain text,images, embeddedvideoandaudiocontents, andscripts(short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supportshyperlinks(embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources.Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites.Web applicationsare web pages that function asapplication software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a commondomain namemake up awebsite. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, andindividual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.
The Web has become the world's dominantinformation systems platform.It is the primary tool that billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.
The Web was invented by English computer scientistTim Berners-Leewhile working atCERN.He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. In his design, Berners-Lee dismissed the commontree structureapproach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system and in theUnix filesystem, as well as approaches that relied in tagging files withkeywords, as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his privateENQUIREsystem (1980) built at CERN. When he became aware ofTed Nelson'shypertextmodel (1965), in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways throughhyperlinksassociated with "hot spots" embedded in the text, it helped to confirm the validity of his concept.
The model was later popularized byApple'sHyperCardsystem. Unlike Hypercard, Berners-Lee's new system from the outset was meant to support links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He also specified that the system should eventually handle other media besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video. Links could refer to  mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other ways (such as traditional computerfile systemsor theUsenet). Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.
Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name.He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser calledWorldWideWeb(which became the name of the project and of the network) andan HTTP serverrunning at CERN. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.The technology was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the whole Internet on 23 August 1991. The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions. Within the next two years,there were 50 websites created.
CERN made the Web protocol and code available royalty free in 1993, enabling its widespread use.After theNCSAreleased theMosaic web browserlater that year, the Web's popularity grew rapidly asthousands of websitessprang up in less than a year.Mosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submitformsthat  were processed by theHTTPd server.Marc AndreessenandJim ClarkfoundedNetscapethe following year and released theNavigator browser, which introducedJavaandJavaScriptto the Web. It quickly became the dominant browser. Netscapebecame a public companyin 1995 which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started thedot-com bubble.Microsoft responded by developing its own browser,Internet Explorer, starting thebrowser wars. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.
Berners-Lee founded theWorld Wide Web Consortium(W3C) which createdXMLin 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricterXHTML.In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature calledXMLHttpRequestto makeAjaxapplications and launched theWeb 2.0revolution.Mozilla,Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created theWHATWGwhich developedHTML5.In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML.In 2019, it ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.
The World Wide Web has been central to the development of theInformation Ageand is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on theInternet.
Tim Berners-Lee states thatWorld Wide Webis officially spelled as three separate words, each capitalised, with no intervening hyphens.Nonetheless, it is often called simplythe Web, and also oftenthe web; seeCapitalization ofInternetfor details. In Mandarin Chinese,World Wide Webis commonly translated via aphono-semantic matchingtowàn wéi wǎng(万维网), which satisfieswwwand literally means "10,000-dimensional net", a translation that reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web.
Use of the www prefix has been declining, especially whenweb applicationssought to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable. As themobile Webgrew in popularity,services likeGmail.com,Outlook.com,Myspace.com,Facebook.com andTwitter.com are most often mentioned without adding "www." (or, indeed, ".com") to the domain.
In English,wwwis usually read asdouble-u double-u double-u.Some users pronounce itdub-dub-dub, particularly in New Zealand.Stephen Fry, in his "Podgrams" series of podcasts, pronounces itwuh wuh wuh.The English writerDouglas Adamsonce quipped inThe Independenton Sunday(1999): "The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for".
The termsInternetandWorld Wide Webare often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system ofcomputer networksinterconnected through telecommunications andoptical networking. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and otherresources, linked by hyperlinks andURIs. Web resources are accessed usingHTTPorHTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet transport protocols.
Viewing aweb pageon the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing theURLof the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (afterchannel surfing), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.
The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URLhttp://example.org/home.html. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (example.org) into anInternet Protocol addressusing the globally distributedDomain Name System(DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as203.0.113.4or2001:db8:2e::7334. The browser then requests the resource by sending anHTTPrequest across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. HTTP normally usesport number 80and for HTTPS it normally usesport number 443. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:
The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:
followed by the content of the requested page. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for a basic web page might look like this:
The web browserparsesthe HTML and interprets the markup (<title>,<p>for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media,scriptsthat affect page behaviour, andCascading Style Sheetsthat affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these otherInternet media types. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressivelyrendersthe page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standardmarkup languagefor creatingweb pagesandweb applications. WithCascading Style Sheets(CSS) andJavaScript, it forms a triad ofcornerstonetechnologies for the World Wide Web.
Web browsersreceive HTML documents from aweb serveror from local storage andrenderthe documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web pagesemanticallyand originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elementsare the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,imagesand other objects such asinteractive formsmay be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to createstructured documentsby denoting structuralsemanticsfor text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated bytags, written usingangle brackets. Tags such as<img/>and<input/>directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as<p>surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in ascripting languagesuch asJavaScript, which affects the behaviour and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. TheWorld Wide Web Consortium(W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:<ahref="http://example.org/home.html">Example.org Homepage</a>.
Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed awebof information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called theWorldWideWeb(in its originalCamelCase, which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.
The hyperlink structure of the web is described by thewebgraph: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called"dead" links. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive websites. TheInternet Archive, active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.
Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin withwwwbecause of the long-standing practice of namingInternethosts according to the services they provide. Thehostnameof aweb serveris oftenwww, in the same way that it may beftpfor anFTP server, andnewsornntpfor aUsenetnews server. These hostnames appear as Domain Name System (DNS) orsubdomainnames, as inwww.example.com. The use ofwwwis not required by any technical or policy standard and many websites do not use it; the first web server wasnxoc01.cern.ch.According to Paolo Palazzi, who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use ofwwwas subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page; however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prependingwwwto an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied.Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such aswww2,secureorenfor special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and thewwwsubdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful forload balancingincoming web traffic by creating aCNAME recordthat points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.
When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix "www" to the beginning of it and possibly ".com", ".org" and ".net" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering "microsoft" may be transformed tohttp://www.microsoft.com/and "openoffice" tohttp://www.openoffice.org. This feature started appearing in early versions ofFirefox, when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such asLynx.It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices.
The scheme specifiershttp://andhttps://at the start of a webURIrefer toHypertext Transfer ProtocolorHTTP Secure, respectively. They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend http:// to user-entered URIs, if omitted.
Aweb page(also written aswebpage) is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web andweb browsers. A web browser displays a web page on amonitorormobile device.
The termweb pageusually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of thecomputer fileitself, which is usually atext filecontaininghypertextwritten inHTMLor a comparablemarkup language. Typical web pages providehypertextfor browsing to other web pages viahyperlinks, often referred to aslinks. Web browsers will frequently have to access multipleweb resourceelements, such as readingstyle sheets,scripts, and images, while presenting each web page.
On a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remoteweb server. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses theHypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) to make such requests to theweb server.
Astaticweb pageis delivered exactly as stored, asweb contentin the web server'sfile system. In contrast, adynamicweb pageis generated by aweb application, usually driven byserver-side software. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.
Astatic web page(sometimes called aflat page/stationary page) is aweb pagethat is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast todynamic web pageswhich are generated by aweb application.
Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of aweb servertonegotiatecontent-typeor language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.
Aserver-side dynamic web pageis aweb pagewhose construction is controlled by anapplication serverprocessing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting,parametersdetermine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
Aclient-side dynamic web pageprocesses the web page using JavaScript running in the browser. JavaScript programs can interact with the document viaDocument Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and alter it. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by acomputer programto change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but adynamic web page updateusingAjaxtechnologies will neither create a page to go back to nor truncate theweb browsing historyforward of the displayed page. Using Ajax technologies the endusergetsone dynamic pagemanaged as a single page in theweb browserwhile the actualweb contentrendered on that page can vary. The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM,theDOM, for its client, from an application server.
Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are notstatic web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization ofAJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used.Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.
JavaScriptis ascripting languagethat was initially developed in 1995 byBrendan Eich, then ofNetscape, for use within web pages.The standardised version isECMAScript.To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such asAjax(asynchronousJavaScript andXML).Client-side scriptis delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularlypollthe server to check whether new information is available.
Awebsiteis a collection of related web resources includingweb pages,multimediacontent, typically identified with a commondomain name, and published on at least oneweb server. Notable examples arewikipedia.org,google.com, andamazon.com.
A website may be accessible via a publicInternet Protocol(IP) network, such as theInternet, or a privatelocal area network(LAN), by referencing auniform resource locator(URL) that identifies the site.
Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be apersonal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment andsocial networkingto providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of anintranet.
Web pages, which are the building blocks of websites, aredocuments, typically composed inplain textinterspersed withformatting instructionsof Hypertext Markup Language (HTML,XHTML). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitablemarkup anchors. Web pages are accessed and transported with theHypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often aweb browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto adisplay terminal.
Hyperlinkingbetween web pages conveys to the reader thesite structureand guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with ahome pagecontaining a directory of the siteweb content. Some websites require user registration orsubscriptionto access content. Examples ofsubscription websitesinclude many business sites, news websites,academic journalwebsites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites,message boards, web-basedemail,social networkingwebsites, websites providing real-time price quotations for different types of markets, as well as sites providing various other services.End userscan access websites on a range of devices, includingdesktopandlaptop computers,tablet computers,smartphonesandsmart TVs.
Aweb browser(commonly referred to as abrowser) is asoftwareuser agentfor accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website'sserverand display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format, and display a web page on the user's computer.
In addition to allowing users to find, display, and move between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below), and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into websites.
The most popular browsers areChrome,Safari,Edge,Samsung InternetandFirefox.
AWeb serverisserver software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests overHTTPand several other related protocols.
The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliverweb pagestoclients.The communication between client and server takes place using theHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequentlyHTML documents, which may includeimages,style sheetsandscriptsin addition to the text content.
Auser agent, commonly aweb browserorweb crawler, initiates communication by making arequestfor a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or anerror messageif unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server'ssecondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the webserver isimplemented.
While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submittingweb forms, includinguploadingof files.
Many generic web servers also supportserver-side scriptingusingActive Server Pages(ASP),PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor), or otherscripting languages. This means that the behaviour of the webserver can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documentsdynamically("on-the-fly") as opposed to returningstatic documents. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information fromdatabases. The latter is typically much faster and more easilycachedbut cannot deliverdynamic content.
Web servers can also frequently be foundembeddedin devices such asprinters,routers,webcamsand serving only alocal network. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with mostoperating systems).
Optical networkingis a sophisticated infrastructure that utilizes optical fiber to transmit data over long distances, connecting countries, cities, and even private residences. The technology uses optical microsystems liketunable lasers, filters,attenuators, switches, and wavelength-selective switches to manage and operate these networks.
The large quantity of optical fiber installed throughout the world at the end of the twentieth century set the foundation of the Internet as it’s used today. The information highway relies heavily on optical networking, a method of sending messages encoded in light to relay information in various telecommunication networks.
TheAdvanced Research Projects Agency Network(ARPANET) was one of the first iterations of the Internet, created in collaboration with universities and researchers 1969.However, access to the ARPANET was limited to researchers, and in 1985, theNational Science Foundationfounded theNational Science Foundation Network(NSFNET), a program that provided supercomputer access to researchers.
Limited public access to the Internet led to pressure from consumers and corporations to privatize the network. In 1993, the US passed theNational Information Infrastructure Act, which dictated that the National Science Foundation must hand over control of the optical capabilities to commercial operators.
The privatization of the Internet and the release of the World Wide Web to the public in 1993 led to an increased demand for Internet capabilities. This spurred developers to seek solutions to reduce the time and cost of laying new fiber and increase the amount of information that can be sent on a single fiber, in order to meet the growing needs of the public.
In 1994, Pirelli S.p.A.'s optical components division introduced a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system to meet growing demand for increased data transmission. This four-channel WDM technology allowed more information to be sent simultaneously over a single optical fiber, effectively boosting network capacity.
Pirelli wasn't the only company that developed a WDM system; another company, theCiena Corporation(Ciena), created its own technology to transmit data more efficiently.David Huber, an optical networking engineer and entrepreneurKevin Kimberlinfounded Ciena in 1992.Drawing on laser technology fromGordon Gouldand William Culver ofOptelecom, Inc., the company focused on utilizing optical amplifiers to transmit data via light.Under chief executive officer Pat Nettles, Ciena developed a dual-stage optical amplifier for dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), patented in 1997 and deployed on the Sprint network in 1996.
AnHTTP cookie(also calledweb cookie,Internet cookie,browser cookie, or simplycookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user'sweb browserwhile the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to rememberstatefulinformation (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons,logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.
Cookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly,authentication cookiesare the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user'sweb browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by ahacker, used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (seecross-site scriptingandcross-site request forgeryfor examples).
Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies, are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories – a potentialprivacy concernthat prompted Europeanand U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.European law requires that all websites targetingEuropean Unionmember states gain "informed consent" from users before storing non-essential cookies on their device.
GoogleProject Zeroresearcher Jann Horn describes ways cookies can be read byintermediaries, likeWi-Fihotspot providers. When in such circumstances, he recommends using the browser inprivate browsingmode (widely known asIncognito modein Google Chrome).
Aweb search engineorInternet search engineis asoftware systemthat is designed to carry outweb search(Internet search), which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in aweb search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to assearch engine results pages(SERPs). The information may be a mix ofweb pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines alsomine dataavailable indatabasesoropen directories. Unlikeweb directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintainreal-timeinformation by running analgorithmon aweb crawler. Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as thedeep web.
In 1990,Archie, the world’s first search engine, was released. The technology was originally an index ofFile Transfer Protocol(FTP) sites, which was a method for moving files between a client and a server network.This early search tool was superseded by more advanced engines likeYahoo!in 1995 andGooglein 1998.
The deep web,invisible web,orhidden webare parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are notindexedby standardweb search engines. The opposite term to the deep web is thesurface web, which is accessible to anyone using the Internet.Computer scientistMichael K. Bergman is credited with coining the termdeep webin 2001 as a search indexing term.
The content of the deep web is hidden behindHTTPforms,and includes many very common uses such asweb mail,online banking, and services that users must pay for, and which is protected by apaywall, such asvideo on demand, some online magazines and newspapers, among others.
The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a directURLorIP addressand may require a password or other security access past the public website page.
Aweb cacheis a server computer located either on the public Internet or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request. Most web browsers also implement abrowser cacheby writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as inonline banking, or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprisefirewallsoften cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Somesearch enginesstore cached content of frequently accessed websites.
Forcriminals, the Web has become a venue to spreadmalwareand engage in a range ofcybercrime, including (but not limited to)identity theft,fraud,espionage, andintelligence gathering.Web-basedvulnerabilitiesnow outnumber traditional computer security concerns,and as measured byGoogle, about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code.Most web-basedattackstake place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured bySophos, are hosted in the United States, China and Russia.The most common of all malwarethreatsisSQL injectionattacks against websites.Through HTML and URIs, the Web was vulnerable to attacks likecross-site scripting(XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScriptand were exacerbated to some degree byWeb 2.0and Ajaxweb designthat favours the use of scripts.In one 2007 estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users.Phishingis another common threat to the Web. In February 2013, RSA (the security division of EMC) estimated the global losses from phishing at $1.5 billion in 2012.Two of the well-known phishing methods are Covert Redirect and Open Redirect.
Proposed solutions vary. Large security companies likeMcAfeealready design governance and compliance suites to meet post-9/11 regulations,and some, likeFinjan Holdingshave recommended active real-time inspection of programming code and all content regardless of its source.Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business opportunity rather than acost centre,while others call for "ubiquitous, always-ondigital rights management" enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks.Jonathan Zittrainhas said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet.
Every time a client requests a web page, the server can identify the request'sIP address. Web servers usually log IP addresses in alog file. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewablehistoryfeature, and usuallycachemuch of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hidepersonally identifiable informationis by using avirtual private network. A VPNencryptstraffic between the client and VPN server, and masks the original IP address, lowering the chance of user identification.
When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information—such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc. web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website usesHTTP cookies, username, and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way, a web-based organization can develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of theirdemographic profile. These profiles are of potential interest to marketers, advertisers, and others. Depending on the website'sterms and conditionsand the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected emails in their inbox or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counterterrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target, and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.
Social networkingsites usually try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences.Online bulliesmay make use of personal information to harass orstalkusers. Modern social networking websites allow fine-grained control of the privacy settings for each posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an online profile. With modern and potentialfacial recognition technology, it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events, and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring, and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.
Web standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of theInternet, not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of websites andweb services. Considerations include theinteroperability,accessibilityandusabilityof web pages and web sites.
Web standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:
Web standards are not fixed sets of rules but are constantly evolving sets of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.Web standards are developed bystandards organizations—groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization—not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in the case ofW3Cspecifications, the highest maturity level).
There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals withdisabilities. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.The Web is receiving information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access andequal opportunityto people with disabilities.Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites.International co-operation in the W3CWeb Accessibility Initiativeled to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be usingassistive technology.
The W3CInternationalisationActivity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and cultures.Beginning in 2004 or 2005,Unicodegained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed bothASCIIand Western European as the Web's most frequently usedcharacter map.OriginallyRFC3986allowed resources to be identified byURIin a subset of US-ASCII.RFC3987allows more characters—any character in theUniversal Character Set—and now a resource can be identified byIRIin any language.
