Gigabit interface converter(GBIC) is a standard fortransceivers. First defined in 1995, it was used withGigabit EthernetandFibre Channel. By standardizing on ahot swappableelectrical interface, a single gigabit port can support a wide range of physical media, from copper to long-wavesingle-mode optical fiber, at lengths of hundreds of kilometers.
Thesmall form-factor pluggable transceiver(SFP), also known as mini-GBIC, succeeds GBIC.Announced in 2001, it obsoleted GBIC.
Flexibility is the benefit ofhot-swappable transceiverslike the GBIC standard as opposed to fixed physical interface configurations. Where optical technologies are mixed, an administrator can just-in-time purchase GBICs of the specific type for each link. This flexibility lowers fixed costs. However, if one port type such as copper predominates, a switch with built-in ports is cheaper and space efficient.
The GBIC standard is openly defined by theSmall Form Factor Committeein document number 8053i.The first publication was in November 1995. A few corrections and additions were made through September 2000. Robert Snively ofBrocade Communicationswas the technical editor.
