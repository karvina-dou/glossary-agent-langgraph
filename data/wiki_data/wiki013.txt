In aFrame Relaynetwork,committed information rate(CIR) is thebandwidthfor avirtual circuitguaranteed by aninternet service providerto  work under normal conditions.Committed data rate(CDR) is thepayloadportion of the CIR.
At any given time, the available bandwidthshould notfall below this committed figure. The bandwidth is usually expressed inkilobits per second(kbit/s).
Above the CIR, an allowance ofburstablebandwidth is often given, whose value can be expressed in terms of an additional rate, known as theexcess information rate(EIR), or as its absolute value,peak information rate(PIR).The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the CIR rate, and sometimes the EIR rate provided that there is adequate bandwidth. The PIR, i.e. the CIR plus EIR, is either equal to or less than the speed of the access port into the network. Frame Relay carriers define and package CIRs differently, and CIRs are adjusted with experience.
